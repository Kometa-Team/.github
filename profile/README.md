The Kometa organization is composed of a number of python-based scripts which are useful for administrators of media servers, namely Plex.

The main script, Kometa, lets you take your media library customization to the next level, with granular control over metadata, collections, overlays, and much more.

We have a range of supporting modules and scripts that serve a wide variety of purposes - from fully automated posters for actors, to community-driven configuration files to use with Kometa.
